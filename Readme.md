# Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyze crime data of modern Chicago and to answer the following questions:

- What are the top 5 crime categories in Chicago?
- What are the city areas where this category is the largest?
- For the largest crime category in Chicago, what are the largest sub-categories?
- Can we provide a daily forecast for the largest crime category one year ahead with acceptable level of accuracy?

# Data
The data is obtained from Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system and includes data from 2001 to January 2017, 16 complete years of crime cases history.
